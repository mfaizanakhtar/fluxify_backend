  # Railway deploys automatically from GitHub
  # Just connect your repo in Railway dashboard:
  # 1. Go to railway.app
  # 2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
  # 3. Select this repo
  # 4. Railway builds with Dockerfile and deploys on every push to main
  #
  # For multiple services (API + Worker):
  # - Add a second service from the same GitHub repo
  # - Override start command: node dist/worker/index.js
